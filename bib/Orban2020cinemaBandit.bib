abstract = {A new visualization tool, Cinema:Bandit, and its demonstration with a continuous workflow for analyzing shock physics experiments and visually exploring the data in real time at X-ray light sources is presented. it Cinema:Bandit is an open-source, web-based visualization application in which the experimenter may explore an aggregated dataset to inform real-time beamline decisions and enable it post hoc data analysis. The tool integrates with experimental workflows that process raw detector data into a simple database format, and it allows visualization of disparate data types, including experimental parameters, line graphs, and images. Use of parallel coordinates accommodates the irregular sampling of experimental parameters and allows for display and filtering of both experimental inputs and measurements. The tool is demonstrated on a dataset of shock-compressed titanium collected at the Matter in Extreme Conditions hutch at the Linac Coherent Light Source.},

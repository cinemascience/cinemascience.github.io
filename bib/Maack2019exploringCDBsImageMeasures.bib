abstract = {Exa-scale simulations can be hard to analyze because it is nearly impossible to store all computed time-steps and other parameters. The Cinema Database provides a storage saving solution, that captures images of each simulation time-step from a variety of camera angles. Still, the resulting number of images can be overwhelming and it is hard to find interesting images and features for further analysis. We present a zoom based approach where users can utilize arbitrary image measures to explore interesting images and further analyze their behavior in detail. We showed the effectiveness of our approach by providing two real world Cinema datasets.},
